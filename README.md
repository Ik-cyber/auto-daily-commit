# Auto Daily Randomized Commits GitHub Action

This project helps you set up an **automatic, randomized daily commit system** using GitHub Actions. It automatically adds a timestamp to a log file multiple times per day and pushes the commits to keep your GitHub contribution graph active (keep your "greens" alive! ðŸŒ±) in a more natural, less robotic way.

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

- Runs **automatically multiple times per day** using GitHub Actions (you donâ€™t need your PC to be on).
- Randomly decides whether to commit or skip to simulate natural behavior.
- Makes **multiple commits per run (randomly between 1 and 4 commits)**.
- Commits are spaced out by **random wait times** to look more human.
- All operations are fully cloud-based and automatic via GitHub.
