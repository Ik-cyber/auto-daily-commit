# Auto Daily Commit GitHub Action

This project helps you set up an **automatic daily commit system** using GitHub Actions. It automatically adds a timestamp to a log file every day and pushes the commit to keep your GitHub contribution graph active (keep your "greens" alive! ðŸŒ±).

## ðŸš€ How It Works

- Runs **automatically every day** using GitHub Actions.
- Appends the current date and time to `daily-log.md`.
- Commits and pushes the change to the repo.
